    </div>
	<p>In the early 1960s(?), Phil conceived the concept of a singing mascot featuring his music. Although a mold of his face was taken for the mascot, technological limitations hindered the full realization of his idea. Following Phil's departure, they STOLE his concept by creating a singing moon character, utilizing the face mold they had previously obtained. The mascot also wore a copy of Phil's signature sunglasses.</p>

	<p>Phil originated the concept for the Filet-O-Fish, initially referred to as the "Phil S, Fish" according to certain documents. Early advertisements subtly hinted at this by incorporating it as an Easter egg to the TRUTH. Even in present times, decades after Phil's departure, McDonald's advertisements continue to feature Easter eggs alluding to the true meaning.</p>
